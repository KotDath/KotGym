# Application Template

The project provides a template for Aurora OS applications.

The main purpose is to demonstrate using a minimum of source code to get a correct and extensible application.  
**To build via ASBT you may need to manually install cmake and ninja packages.  You should also wait for a fix so that the lupdate utility for cross-compiler translations works.**

Build status:
1. example - [![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/omprussia/demos/KotGym/badges/example/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/omprussia/demos/KotGym/-/commits/example)
